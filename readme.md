# algorithms

Implementations of essential algorithms and tools for profiling and visualizing their performance.

Below is the runtime complexity for an implementation of insertion sort for various sizes of input, ordered ascending, descending, and randomly. More graphs in [/examples](https://github.com/jtschoonhoven/algorithms/tree/master/examples).
